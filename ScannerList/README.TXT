Short:  ScannerList supports dxlAPRS Chain finding any active frequency. You will not know where to listen by fixed frequency list anymore.

It uses the csv output from already installed RTL_POWER and creates a sdrcfg.txt file for dxlSondemonitoring Software.
Look for the documentation.

It looks complete now, so feel free to use it.
